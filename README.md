**Better Posters** is an unofficial Jellyfin plugin that lets you replace standard movie and show posters with customizable posters from [btttr.cc](https://btttr.cc).

</div>

> [!WARNING]
> **We've moved to GitHub — please reinstall Better Posters (migrated 2026-08-25).**
> Better Posters is now officially hosted on GitHub. If you installed it from the former GitLab plugin repository, replace that repository and reinstall the plugin:
>
> 1. In Jellyfin, open **Dashboard -> Plugins -> Repositories** and remove the old **Better Posters** repository that uses `code.neureka.dev`.
> 2. Add the new repository URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neurekadev/better-posters/master/manifest.json`
> 3. Reinstall **Better Posters** from **Dashboard -> Plugins -> Catalog**, then restart Jellyfin.

**Minimum Jellyfin version:** 10.11.10

## Features

- **Movies and Shows:** Registers as a remote primary image provider for movie and series items.
- **Configurable Poster Overlays:** Toggle trend tags, quality badges, genre, rating, and age rating.
- **Rating Source Selection:** Use btttr.cc average ratings or choose IMDb, TMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, Trakt, Letterboxd, or Roger Ebert.
- **Multi-Language Posters:** Select English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Hindi, Swedish, or Czech.
- **Scheduled Replacement:** Optionally replace existing movie and show posters through Jellyfin Scheduled Tasks.

## Installation Guide

### Option 1: Install from the Plugin Repository

1. Open **Dashboard -> Plugins -> Repositories** in Jellyfin.
2. Add this repository URL:

    ```text
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neurekadev/better-posters/master/manifest.json
    ```

3. Open **Dashboard -> Plugins -> Catalog**.
4. Select **Better Posters** and install the latest compatible version.
5. Restart Jellyfin.
6. Confirm **Better Posters** appears under **Dashboard -> Plugins -> My Plugins**.

### Option 2: Install Manually from a Release

1. Download the latest `better-posters_*.zip` asset from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/neurekadev/better-posters/releases/latest).
2. Stop Jellyfin.
3. Create a Better Posters plugin folder under your Jellyfin plugins directory.
4. Extract the release zip into that folder.
5. Start Jellyfin.
6. Confirm **Better Posters** appears under **Dashboard -> Plugins -> My Plugins**.

### Option 3: Build from Source

1. Install the .NET SDK that can build `net9.0` projects.
2. From this repository, run:

    ```shell
    dotnet publish BetterPosters/BetterPosters.csproj -c Release
    ```

3. Locate the published `BetterPosters.dll`.
4. Stop Jellyfin.
5. Create a Better Posters plugin folder under your Jellyfin plugins directory.
6. Copy `BetterPosters.dll` into that folder.
7. Start Jellyfin.
8. Confirm **Better Posters** appears under **Dashboard -> Plugins -> My Plugins**.

This plugin is built for Jellyfin 10.11.10 and may not load on older Jellyfin versions.

## Configuration & Setup

Open **Dashboard -> Plugins -> My Plugins -> Better Posters**.

Default settings:

- **Trend Tags:** Enabled
- **Quality Tags:** Disabled
- **Genre:** Enabled
- **Ratings:** Enabled
- **Ratings Source:** Average
- **Age Rating:** Disabled
- **Language:** English

The **Update Better Posters** scheduled task is unscheduled by default. Configure it under **Dashboard -> Scheduled Tasks** to replace existing primary posters for Movies and Shows that have an IMDb ID.

## How to Apply Posters to Your Library

### Option A: Apply to a Single Movie or Show

1. Open a Movie or Show in Jellyfin.
2. Select **Edit Images**.
3. Search remote images.
4. Choose the Better Posters primary image.

### Option B: Apply During Metadata Refresh

1. Go to **Dashboard -> Libraries**.
2. Open the menu for a Movies or Shows library.
3. Select **Scan Library**.
4. Choose metadata refresh options that replace existing images.

### Option C: Apply Automatically

1. Open **Dashboard -> Scheduled Tasks**.
2. Select **Update Better Posters**.
3. Add the schedule you want Jellyfin to use.
4. The scheduled task will replace matching movie and show primary images using the current poster settings.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Better Posters image appears:** Confirm the item has an IMDb ID. This plugin intentionally uses IMDb IDs for btttr.cc URLs.
- **Plugin does not load:** Confirm the server is Jellyfin 10.11.10 or newer in the 10.11 line and restart Jellyfin after copying the plugin DLL.
- **Poster did not change after selecting one:** Clear the browser cache or check another Jellyfin client. Jellyfin and browsers can cache images aggressively.

This is an unofficial Jellyfin plugin. Poster artwork and generated image output are provided by [btttr.cc](https://btttr.cc).
